Widget child
  
_<span class="feature">final</span><span class="feature">inherited</span>_



<p>The widget below this widget in the tree.</p>
<p>This widget can only have one child. To lay out multiple children, let this
widget's child be a widget such as <code>Row</code>, <code>Column</code>, or <code>Stack</code>, which have a
<code>children</code> property, and then provide the children to that widget.</p>



## Implementation

```dart
final Widget child;
```
