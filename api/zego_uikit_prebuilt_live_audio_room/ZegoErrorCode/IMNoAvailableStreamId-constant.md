# IMNoAvailableStreamId constant







int const IMNoAvailableStreamId
  




<p>Description: The stream ID to start broadcasting is not available. <br>Cause: The stream ID has been used in this device for RTC business (e.g. <code>startPublishingStream</code> / <code>startPlayingStream</code>). <br>Solution: Please use another stream ID for broadcasting.</p>



## Implementation

```dart
static const int IMNoAvailableStreamId = 1009034;
```
