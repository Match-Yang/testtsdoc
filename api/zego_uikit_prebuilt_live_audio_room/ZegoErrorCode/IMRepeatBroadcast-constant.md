# IMRepeatBroadcast constant







int const IMRepeatBroadcast
  




<p>Description: Repeat broadcast. <br>Cause: The developer repeatedly calls the <code>startBroadcasting</code> function. <br>Solution: Please check the business logic to avoid repeating the broadcast for the stream which is broadcasting.</p>



## Implementation

```dart
static const int IMRepeatBroadcast = 1009035;
```
