bool isUserStatusNotify
  
_<span class="feature">read / write</span>_



<p>Whether to enable the user in and out of the room callback notification <code>onRoomUserUpdate</code>, the default is off. If developers need to use ZEGO Room user notifications, make sure that each user who login sets this flag to true</p>

bool isUserStatusNotify;
```
