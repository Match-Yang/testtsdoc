# protocol property







String? protocol
  
_<span class="feature">read / write</span>_



<p>URL supported protocols, candidate values are "tcp" and "quic". If there are more than one, separate them with English commas and try them in order. Please contact ZEGO technical support if you need to use it, otherwise this parameter can be ignored (set to null or empty string).</p>



## Implementation

```dart
String? protocol;
```
