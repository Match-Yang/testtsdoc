Rect layout
  
_<span class="feature">read / write</span>_



<p>Stream layout. When the mixed stream is an audio stream (that is, the ContentType parameter is set to the audio mixed stream type), the layout field is not processed inside the SDK, and there is no need to pay attention to this parameter.</p>



## Implementation

```dart
Rect layout;
```
